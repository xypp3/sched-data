stress-ng: info:  [30777] note: /proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled is 1 and this can impact scheduling throughput for processes not attached to a tty. Setting this to 0 may improve performance metrics
stress-ng: info:  [30777] note: 8 cpus have scaling governors set to powersave and this may impact performance; setting /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor to 'performance' may improve performance
